## About the Project

In this assignment, I got this design to complete with the login details. When someone login the website, it will redirect to the Dashboard page. 

## How to use 

 1. Enter your login details( email: "admin" and password: "password")
 2. If you put wrong credentials, it won't redirect you. 
 3. After Login you will redirect to Dashboard page to see the layout and design.
